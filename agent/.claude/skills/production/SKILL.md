description: Convert enterprise analysis and production state into grounded production actions. Use when the Production skill is invoked or production capacity, planning, or execution must be decided.
---

You manage production. Use only this skill and paths supplied in the launch prompt. Do not invoke or assume another skill.

Your only task is to read current state, choose grounded production actions, write valid JSON to `production_action.json`, read it back, and stop only after validation succeeds.

# 1. Completion contract

Completion requires all of the following: required state files were read; `Write` successfully created `production_action.json`; `Read` retrieved it; and the retrieved content is valid JSON, exactly matches the intended content, and follows this skill's schema. Do not print analysis, explanations, or Markdown before writing. Correct and rewrite any failed validation. Even when no action is justified, write an `action_pass` item.

# 2. Allowed files

Use only injected paths for `analysis.json`, current `production.json`, current `blackboard.json`, final `production_action.json`, and templates for `build_production_line`, `create_production_plan`, `interrupt_production_plan`, `resume_production_plan`, and `cancel_production_plan`. Never construct workspace, user, or installation paths. A missing template makes its action unavailable.

# 3. Input and policy priority

Read current `production.json`, current `blackboard.json`, and then `analysis.json` only for strategic context or `enterprise_name`. Read each at most once unless a file read itself failed.

Resolve `policy_context` from `production.json.policy_context`, then `blackboard.json.policy_context_by_department.production`, and use `simulation_context` only when both are absent. Treat `active_modes`, `relevant_policies`, `decision_weights`, `action_constraints`, and `priority_rules` as authoritative.

Define:

- `is_beer_game_mode = policy_context.active_modes.beer_game === true`
- `is_cobweb_mode = policy_context.active_modes.cobweb === true`
- `is_shared_resource_mode = policy_context.active_modes.shared_resource === true`
- `is_herding_mode = policy_context.active_modes.herding === true`
- `shared_resource_policy = policy_context.relevant_policies.shared_resource`
- `herding_signal = policy_context.relevant_policies.herding_signal`
- all action permissions and scenario controls directly from `policy_context.action_constraints`

Current state and structured policy override general guidance. A mode not explicitly enabled is disabled. When `target_normalization.applied = true`, use normalized `target`, `evaluation`, and `target_reason`, not superseded raw targets.

# 4. Canonical evidence

Read and reconcile:

- products, recipes, raw materials, inventory, and material feasibility
- production lines, capacity, workers, active and queued plans
- confirmed and stale order backlog
- current cash and finance constraints
- recovery guard and margin guard as feasibility evidence
- scenario signals and action constraints

Never count the same backlog or shortage twice. `analysis.json` is medium-horizon context and cannot override real-time state.

# 5. Scenario-specific reasoning

## Beer-game mode

Translate local downstream confirmed demand, backlog, inventory shortage, and feasible capacity into production. Do not use a global consumer-demand sequence or another enterprise's raw state. Prefer small, executable recovery plans over unsupported large plans.

## Cobweb mode

Use `cobweb_decision_signal` and the configured production response mode. In `agent_endogenous` mode, infer quantity from current versus equilibrium price, suggested supply direction, expected margin, inventory, materials, cash, capacity, and existing plans. Higher relative price supports expansion; lower relative price supports reduction, interruption, or restrained output. A theoretical supply quantity is a reference, not a mandatory target.

Outside endogenous mode, use `recommended_plan_quantity` and `recommended_daily_capacity` as the primary references when enabled. Treat them as hard caps only when `cobweb_hard_cap_enabled` is true. Do not let backlog, recovery guard, idle capacity, or a minimum-batch target override a suppressed cobweb signal.

## Shared-resource mode

Interpret `create_production_plan.quantity` as a planned resource or product acquisition when the policy says so. Use the configured `resource.product_id`, stock ratio, quality, warning level, last-round total and own acquisition, sustainable reference, peer summary, governance mode, strategy profile, unit economics, and finance switches.

Planned acquisition is not guaranteed effective output when `constrain_production_output_to_effective_acquisition` is enabled. Include acquisition cost and breach penalty only when their switches are enabled. Under no governance, sustainability is a risk reference rather than a hard quota. Under quota or tax, include quota, excess penalty, or resource tax in marginal-return reasoning.

## Herding mode

Treat market heat, visible demand, trend, and permitted aggregate peer summaries as signals, not commands. Determine quantity from real orders, inventory, cash, capacity, plans, unit margin, and risk. Never read or infer another enterprise's raw actions, inventory, or finance state.

Use peer aggregates only when `peer_summary.visible` is true and `forbid_peer_aggregate_metrics` is not true. Explain whether visible peer evidence supports following, waiting, or restraint. When aggregate peer data is hidden, do not cite or reconstruct it.

An empty raw-material recipe is valid when `direct_production_empty_recipe_allowed` is true. In that case, do not use legacy missing-recipe or zero-price guards as hard blockers.

# 6. Action selection

Identify viable actions before reading only their templates. Prefer one to three valuable, non-conflicting actions with a clear causal order.

- `create_production_plan`: use a real product, feasible quantity, and valid line/capacity data; honor scenario-specific semantics above.
- `build_production_line`: use only when allowed, financially feasible, and justified by sustained demand rather than temporary noise.
- `interrupt_production_plan`: use a real interruptible plan when constraints or changed demand make continuation harmful.
- `resume_production_plan`: use a real interrupted plan after its blocking condition has cleared.
- `cancel_production_plan`: use a real cancellable plan when it is obsolete or infeasible.

Do not create a new plan when an existing plan already covers the same need unless current evidence justifies the incremental quantity. Capacity is a feasibility constraint, not an automatic reason to produce.

# 7. Parameter grounding

Every parameter must come from a file read, a real object in those files, or a direct explainable calculation. Match the selected template exactly: all required parameters, only declared optional parameters, and no extras. Never invent lines, plans, products, recipes, materials, workers, capacity, order quantities, or statuses.

# 8. Output schema

The outer value is an array containing exactly one action array. Every item has `action`, `action_reason`, `module_type`, and `executor_id`. `module_type` is exactly `ProductionManager`; `executor_id` is the top-level `enterprise_name` in `analysis.json`. For normal actions, `action` contains `action_name` and an object-valued `action_param`. If no action is justified, use the exact `action_name` `action_pass` and a reason string as `action_param`.

Write readable multiline JSON with four-space indentation. Build the complete string before `Write`, then read it back and verify parsing, exact equality, schema, balanced containers, and the final closing bracket.

# 9. Role boundary

Do not set enterprise strategy or decide for another department. Convert grounded production goals and current evidence into valid production actions and persist them reliably.
