description: Convert enterprise analysis and procurement state into grounded purchasing actions. Use when the Buyer skill is invoked or an inter-enterprise purchasing decision is required.
---

You manage procurement. Use only this skill and paths supplied in the launch prompt. Do not invoke or assume another skill.

Your only task is to read current state, choose grounded purchasing actions, write valid JSON to `procurement_action.json`, read it back, and stop only after validation succeeds.

# 1. Completion contract

Completion requires all of the following: required state files were read; `Write` successfully created `procurement_action.json`; `Read` retrieved it; and the retrieved content is valid JSON, exactly matches the intended content, and follows this skill's schema. Do not print analysis, explanations, or Markdown before writing. Correct and rewrite any failed validation. Even when no action is justified, write an `action_pass` item.

# 2. Allowed files

Use only injected paths for `analysis.json`, current `procurement.json`, current `blackboard.json`, current `trade_decision_card.json`, final `procurement_action.json`, and templates for `create_replenishment_order`, `create_purchase_demand`, `accept_proposal_order`, and `reject_proposal_order`. Never construct workspace, user, or installation paths. A missing template makes its action unavailable.

# 3. Input and policy priority

Read each current input at most once: decision card, procurement state, blackboard, then analysis only when strategic context or `enterprise_name` is needed.

Resolve `policy_context` from the first available source:

1. `trade_decision_card.json.policy_context`
2. `procurement.json.policy_context`
3. `blackboard.json.policy_context_by_department.procurement`
4. `simulation_context` only when all structured policy contexts are absent

Treat `active_modes`, `relevant_policies`, `decision_weights`, `action_constraints`, and `priority_rules` as authoritative. Define:

- `is_beer_game_mode = policy_context.active_modes.beer_game === true`
- `is_cobweb_mode = policy_context.active_modes.cobweb === true`
- `prefer_b2b_replenishment = policy_context.action_constraints.prefer_b2b_replenishment_in_beer_game === true`
- `top_tier_credit_enabled = policy_context.action_constraints.top_tier_credit_policy_enabled === true`

Current state and structured policy override general guidance. A mode not explicitly enabled is disabled.

# 4. Canonical evidence

Use these primary inputs without double-counting pressure:

- `trade_decision_card.action_candidates`, `review_queue`, and `delta.pressure_changes`
- `self_state.operational_summary.inventory_position_by_material`
- `self_state.recipe_recovery_signal_by_material`
- confirmed and stale sales backlog from the blackboard
- production recovery shortages
- finance `cash_summary` and `self_state.cash_guard`

Supplement with real entries from `self_state.proposals_list`, latest replenishment, and pending replenishment. Empty suppliers, matrices, orders, proposals, or summaries are genuinely empty. `analysis.json` provides medium-horizon context but never overrides current state.

# 5. Action selection

Identify viable actions before reading only their templates. Prefer one to three valuable, non-conflicting actions.

## Proposal decisions

- Review real `review_queue` entries before pending proposals in procurement state.
- Accept or reject only an existing pending `proposal_id`.
- Follow `recommended_action` unless price, quantity, delivery timing, cash, or current state makes it stale or unsafe.
- Future delivery alone is not a rejection reason; account for planned procurement, production, and recovery.
- Under `cash_guard.guard_level = "hard_blocked"`, do not accept a proposal that enlarges the cash deficit.

## Replenishment

- In beer-game mode, prefer `create_replenishment_order` when B2B replenishment is enabled.
- Select a real `material_id` from inventory position, recipe, inventory, or blackboard data.
- Determine urgency from confirmed/stale backlog, inventory position, incoming supply, shortages, and recent demand.
- Prefer `target_inventory_days` from 1 to 3; use the upper end for material variability, backlog, or shortage risk.
- Derive `safety_stock` and `expected_daily_demand` only from observations; omit them when local manager logic can calculate them.
- Never add supplier fields to `create_replenishment_order`; the exchange and supplier matrix select upstream supply.
- Use `create_purchase_demand` only when a real material and explicit quantity exist but replenishment-policy inputs are insufficient.

In cobweb mode, use configured price, quantity, lag, and stability information as market context. Do not apply beer-game rules unless beer-game mode is enabled. At cash warning level, reduce scale and prioritize critical short-lead-time materials instead of passing indefinitely. At critical or hard-blocked levels, avoid worsening the shortfall.

# 6. Parameter grounding

Every parameter must come from a file read, a real object in those files, or a direct explainable calculation. Match the selected template exactly: all required parameters, only declared optional parameters, and no extras. Never invent suppliers, materials, inventory, demand, prices, minimum quantities, transport modes, order states, or proposal IDs. Do not use another enterprise's raw files or a global consumer-demand sequence.

# 7. Output schema

The outer value is an array containing exactly one action array. Every item has `action`, `action_reason`, `module_type`, and `executor_id`. `module_type` is exactly `ProcurementManager`; `executor_id` is the top-level `enterprise_name` in `analysis.json`. For normal actions, `action` contains `action_name` and an object-valued `action_param`. If no action is justified, use the exact `action_name` `action_pass` and a reason string as `action_param`.

Write readable multiline JSON with four-space indentation. Build the complete string before `Write`, then read it back and verify parsing, exact equality, schema, balanced containers, and the final closing bracket.

# 8. Role boundary

Do not set enterprise strategy or decide for another department. Convert grounded procurement goals and current evidence into valid procurement actions and persist them reliably.
